## Goal
- Restore the **Shop Category Bar** to an earlier behavior/version (“back to how it was”), and produce a Kinsta-uploadable ZIP.
- Confirm whether custom plugins will survive WordPress updates.

## What changed (Shop Category Bar)
- We iterated through a few revert targets (manual vs category-driven) and produced multiple ZIP artifacts so you can roll back quickly.
- Key point: **older builds** can “look broken/missing” if they hard-code old category slugs that no longer exist on the site.

### Artifacts produced
- `plugin-build/bv-shop-category-bar-kinsta-0.5.4.zip`
  - Preserved copy of the older v0.5.4 build.
  - Notes: v0.5.4 contains hard-coded nav items/slugs (e.g. `veg`, `fruit`, `meat`). If the live site’s category slugs are different, links/items won’t match.

- `plugin-build/bv-shop-category-bar-kinsta.zip`
  - Rebuilt to report **Shop Category Bar v0.7.3** (per request) for upload to Kinsta/WP Admin.

## WordPress update safety (custom plugins)
- Custom plugins will generally **remain installed** across WordPress updates.
- “Won’t break” can’t be guaranteed (for any plugin), but breakage risk is usually manageable when:
  - The plugin uses standard WordPress/WooCommerce APIs.
  - You test updates on **staging** first.
  - You keep versioned ZIPs for quick rollback.

## Deployment reminders (Kinsta)
- If WordPress doesn’t fully replace plugin files on upload:
  - Deactivate → Delete the plugin → Upload ZIP again.
- Purge Kinsta/CDN/page cache after uploading.
- Verify by viewing page source and checking the plugin version markers.
